## DNS and Internet Connectivity Test

### Tests Performed
- Pinged public IP address (8.8.8.8)
- Pinged domain name (google.com)

### Results
- 8.8.8.8: 0% packet loss, ~19 ms average latency
- google.com: 0% packet loss, ~20 ms average latency

### Conclusion
Successful responses from both a public IP address and a domain name confirm that:
- The router can route traffic to the internet
- DNS name resolution is functioning correctly
