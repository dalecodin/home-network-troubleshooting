# Home Network Documentation

## Overview
This project documents a home network to demonstrate networking knowledge relevant to entry-level IT and Helpdesk roles.

## What This Demonstrates
- DHCP, DNS, and IP addressing fundamentals
- Local vs internet connectivity testing
- DNS troubleshooting using commands
- Understanding of ISP managed network limitations
- Clear technical documentation for IT support roles


## Network Summary
- ISP-provided cable modem/router acting as:
  - Default gateway
  - DHCP server
  - DNS forwarder
- Private IPv4 network: 192.168.1.0/24
- Clients connected via Wi-Fi
